# KYC AML Compliance Data Analysis
This project demonstrates a mock KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) data analysis workflow using Python and Jupyter/Colab. It showcases how financial institutions can perform customer risk scoring, detect suspicious activity, and generate compliance reporting.
## Project Contents
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis
- `data/` — Mock KYC/AML datasets (CSV/Excel)
- `scripts/` — Python scripts for reusable functions and data processing
- `visualizations/` — Charts and graphs generated from the analysis
## Key Features
- Load and clean KYC/AML data
- Perform risk scoring on customers
- Identify PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) flagged accounts
- Generate visual dashboards for compliance insights
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- CSV / Excel for mock datasets
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.
4. All files are mock data; no real sensitive information is included.

## Disclaimer
This project is for **educational and portfolio purposes only**. All data is simulated and does not contain any real customer information.
